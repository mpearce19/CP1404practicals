Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# ValueError will occur when a valid value is not entered as one of the numbers. e.g. if no numbers are entered
# ZeroDivisionError will occur when the user try's to divide by 0
# The code could be changed to avoid a ZeroDivisionError by making it impossible to input a zero.
